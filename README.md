# OrdMap & HashMap
* AVL is not worse than RBTree, and is also a feasible way to resolve Hash Collision Attack.
* This package expose two public structs: `OrdMap` which implemented by optimized AVL, `HashMap` whose every index contains an AVL-Tree.
* To improve performance, raw pointer is used frequently. Because Rust uses a similar memory model to C/C++, two classic macros
`offset_of` and `container_of` are used to dereference member variables into main struct.
`Fastbin` is implemented to reduce the cost of memory allocation.
# Usage
Notice the Trait. Usage of most functions is same as STL HashMap, you can find examples in test case. 
```
impl<K, V, S> HashMap<K, V, S> where K: Ord + Hash, S: BuildHasher
impl<K, V> OrdMap<K, V> where K: Ord
```
# Performance Test
## Environment
```
Linux version 4.4.0-1049-aws (buildd@lcy01-amd64-001) (gcc version 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.5) )
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2676 v3 @ 2.40GHz
```
## AVL Compare with RBTree
Somebody has already implemented RBTree, append `rbtree = "0.1.5"` to your `Cargo.toml [dependencies]`, then run commend
```
cargo run --release --example avl_cmp_rbtree
```
* Obviously, optimized AVL is not worse than RBTree, and with the advantage of smaller height, it works better in searching case.
It performs much better in clear case benefit from `Fastbin`

## HashMap Competition
Run commend
```
cargo run --release --example hash_map_cmp
```
* Our HashMap performs better in case of insert and search.
* When facing Collision Attack, the runtime complexity of STL HashMap can be _O(n)_, but ours is _O(log n)_.
